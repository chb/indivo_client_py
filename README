This Branch is a version of the client specifically intended to run
against the Django test client. Instead of sending requests over the wire,
it pipes them into a django test client provided on initialization. It is 
thus only functional if used within the context of a django application
like indivo_server.

BEFORE FIRST USE: You must generate the /lib/api.py file by:

$ cd lib
$ python ./create_api.py
